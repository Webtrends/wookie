# Wookiee - Metrics Config

Entry name for config is "wookiee-metrics". This would be the string you would use in lib-components if using that mechanism to load components.

| Name | Default                                                  | Description |
|:-----|:---------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| manager | com.oracle.infy.wookiee.component.metrics.MetricsManager | This should never be overridden or changed, and changing this would most likely cause it to not start up. |
| enabled | true                                                     | whether this component is enabled or not. |
| dynamic-component | true                                                     | enables loading up the component dynamically |
| application-name | Oracle Wookiee                                           | application name used for persisting metrics |
| metric-prefix | workstations                                             | prefix to append metrics being sent to graphite |
| jmx.enabled | true                                                     | |
| jmx.port | 9999                                                     | |
