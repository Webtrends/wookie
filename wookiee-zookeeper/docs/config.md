# Wookiee - Component: Zookeeper Config

Entry name for config is "wookiee-zookeeper". This would be the string you would use in lib-components if using that mechanism to load components.

| Name | Default                                                      | Description |
|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| manager | com.oracle.infy.wookiee.component.zookeeper.ZookeeperManager | This should never be overridden or changed, and changing this would most likely cause it to not start up. |
| enabled | true                                                         | whether this component is enabled or not. |
| dynamic-component | true                                                         | enables loading up the component dynamically |
| datacenter | Lab                                                          | data center to point to |
| pod | H                                                            | environment within that center |
| quorum | ""                                                           | Required field and would be the list of fqdn to the zookeeper quorum |
| session-timeout | 30s                                                          | The zookeeper session timeout. Defaults to 30 seconds. |
| connection-timeout | 30s                                                          | The alloted time to try an connect to zookeeper. Defaults to 30 seconds. |
| retry-sleep | 5s                                                           | The alloted time to sleep before trying to connect to zookeeper. Defaults to 5 seconds. |
| retry-count | 150                                                          | The number of times to retry to connect to zookeeper. Defaults to 150. |
| base-path | /discovery/clusters                                          | If using clustering as well needs to be the same as the base path in the clusters config discovery.cluster.base-path |
